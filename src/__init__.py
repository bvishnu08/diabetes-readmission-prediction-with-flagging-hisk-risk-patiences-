"""
This file makes the 'src' folder a Python package.

Think of it like this: Python needs this file (even if it's empty) to know that
the 'src' folder contains code that can be imported. Without this file, you
couldn't do things like `from src.config import Config`.

It's basically saying "Hey Python, this folder is a package, treat it specially!"
"""

# This comment tells Python: "Yes, this folder is a package!"
# Even though the file is mostly empty, its existence is what matters.
